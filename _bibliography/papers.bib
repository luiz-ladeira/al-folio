abstract = {Medicinal plant species are genetically engineered to obtain higher production of biomass and specific secondary metabolites, which can be used in the pharmaceutical industry. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of Pfaffia glomerata (Spreng.) Pedersen tetraploid hydroalcoholic extract on the liver of adult Swiss mice. The extract was prepared from the plant roots and given to the animals by gavage, for 42 days. The experimental groups were treated with water (control), Pfaffia glomerata tetraploid hydroalcoholic extract (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) and Pfaffia glomerata tetraploid hydroalcoholic extract discontinuously (200 mg/kg). The last group received the extract every 3 days, for 42 days. The oxidative status, mineral dynamics, and cell viability were analysed. The liver weight and the number of viable hepatocytes were reduced, despite the increased cell's number. Increased levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide, and changes in iron, copper, zinc, potassium, manganese and sodium levels were observed. aspartate aminotransferase levels were increased while alanine aminotransferase levels were decreased due to BGEt intake. Our results showed that BGEt induced alterations of oxidative stress biomarkers leading to liver injury, which was associated with a reduction in the number of hepatocytes.},

abstract = {Background: Some residues such as the heavy metals cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr VI), nickel (Ni), and arsenic (As), this last one in its oxidized forms + 5 (arsenate) and + 3 (arsenite), can cause injuries to human health, so they are currently considered environmental health emergencies. In the testis, heavy metals can cause morphological and functional damage due to constant exposure acting chronically in individuals. Thus, we aimed to determine the toxicological mechanism of As+5, As+3, Cd, Cr VI, and Ni that leads to testicular damage and establish for the first time an order of toxicity among these studied heavy metals. Methods: Forty-two Swiss mice at reproductive age (140 days) were used, randomly distributed into seven experimental groups (n = 6). Exposure to heavy metals was weekly performed, by intraperitoneal route. Group 1 received 0.7 mL 0.9% saline (control), and the other groups received 1.5 mg/ kg of As+5, As+3, Cd, Pb, Cr VI, or Ni, for six weeks. Results: These studied heavy metals did not accumulate in the testis tissue. However, exposure to Ni induced moderate pathologies in the seminiferous tubules, plus changes in the tunica propria, blood vessels, lymphatic space, and carbonyl protein levels. Cd exposure caused moderate tubular histopathologies and changes in the blood vessels and lymphatic space. Cr VI induced slight tubular histopathologies, changes in the lymphatic space, blood vessels, and SOD activity. Pb and As+3 exposure triggered moderate tubular pathologies and changes in the SOD activity and carbonyl protein levels, respectively. Finally, As+5 induced only slight tubular pathologies. Conclusion: The testicular histopathologies caused by the studied heavy metals are mainly triggered by changes in testicular oxidative balance. Based on our findings of histomorphological alterations, the toxicity order among the heavy metals is Ni>Cd>Cr(VI)>Pb[dbnd]As+3 >As+5. However, considering oxidative stress results, we propose the following testicular toxicity order for these heavy metals: Ni>As+3 > Cd>Cr(VI)>Pb>As+5. Ni exposure shows the most harmful among the heavy metals to the testis.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that the consumption of chia (Salvia hispanica L.) flour (CF) and chia oil (CO) improves metabolic disorders in the liver of Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus domestica) fed a high-fat and high-fructose (HFHF) diet. The animals were fed a HFHF diet (n = 30) or AIN93-M standard diet (n = 10) for eight weeks. After this period, the animals fed HFHF were divided into three groups (n = 10): HFHF diet, HFHF plus 14.7% of CF, and HFHF plus 4% of CO. Histological and biochemical analyses, gene expression, protein levels related to inflammation, and oxidative stress were evaluated in the liver. The HFHF diet caused lipogenesis, liver steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the animals. The CF and CO intake increased the liver total antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase, decreased nitric oxide levels and liver steatosis. Furthermore, the CF and CO led to the upregulation of Cpt1a and Adipor2, respectively, whereas CF downregulated Srebf1. CO intake decreased blood glucose, triglycerides, and the animals' body weight. Chia did not show effects on mitigating liver pro-inflammatory status, which it may indicate occurs later. The addition of chia into an unbalanced diet is a good and relevant strategy to reduce liver metabolic disorders caused by the high consumption of fructose and saturated fat.},

abstract = {Green tea is a popular drink used for therapeutic purposes to mitigate the consequences of diabetes. In this study, we aimed at evaluating the potential of green tea infusion to ameliorate structural and enzymatic damages caused by hyperglycemia in the testis and epididymis of Wistar rats. For that, nondiabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (negative control and diabetes control, respectively) received 0.6 mL of water by gavage. Another set of diabetic animals received 100 mg/kg of green tea infusion diluted in 0.6 mL of water/gavage (diabetes + green tea) daily. After 42 days of treatment, the testes and epididymides were removed and processed for histopathological analysis, micromineral determination, and enzymatic assays. The results showed that treatment with green tea infusion preserved the testicular and epididymal histoarchitecture, improving the seminiferous epithelium and the sperm production previously affected by diabetes. Treatment with green tea reduced tissue damages caused by this metabolic condition. Given the severity of hyperglycemia, there was no efficacy of the green tea infusion in maintaining the testosterone levels, antioxidant enzyme activity, and microminerals content. Thus, our findings indicate a protective effect of this infusion on histological parameters, with possible use as a complementary therapy for diabetes.},

abstract = {Aims: Although excessive fat and caffeine intake are independent risk factors for bone microstructural and functional disturbances, their association remains overlooked. Thus, we investigated the impact of high-fat diet (HFD) and caffeine alone and combined on serum lipid profile, bone microstructure, mi- cromineral distribution and biomechanical properties. Methods: Forty female C57BL/6 mice were randomized into 4 groups daily treated for seventeen weeks with standard diet (SD) or HFD (cafeteria diet) alone or combined with 50 mg/kg caffeine. Key findings: The association between HFD and caffeine reduced the weight gain compared to animals re- ceiving HFD alone. Caffeine alone or combined with HFD increases total and HDL cholesterol circulating levels. HFD also reduced calcium, phosphorus and magnesium bone levels compared to the groups receiv- ing SD, and this reduction was aggravated by caffeine coadministration. From biomechanical assays, HFD combined with caffeine increased bending strength and stiffness of tibia, a finding aligned with the marked microstructural remodeling of the cortical and cancellous bone in animals receiving this combina- tion. Significance: Our findings indicated that HFD and caffeine interact to induce metabolic changes and bone microstructural remodeling, which are potentially related to bone biomechanical adaptations in response to HFD and caffeine coadministration.},

abstract = {Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) is a powerful technical tool used in biomedical field to investigate the proportion of chemical elements of interest in research, such as heavy metal bioaccumulation and the enzymatic cofactors and nanoparticle therapy in various pathologies. However, the correct evaluation of the proportion of the elements is subject to some factors, including the method of sample preservation. In this study, we seek to investigate the effect of biological tissue preservation methods on the proportion of chemical elements obtained by the EDS methodology. For such, we used EDS to measure the proportion of chemical elements with biomedical interest in preserved livers, using three common methods for preserving biological tissues: a) Freezing, b) Paraformaldehyde fixative solution and c) Karnovsky solution. We found an increased level of sodium and reduced contents of potassium and copper in samples fixed in fixative solutions, when compared to frozen samples (p < 0.05). Our data indicate that preservation methods can change the proportion of chemical elements in biological samples, when measured by EDS. Frozen preservation should be preferred to retain the actual chemical content of samples and allow a correct assessment of the proportion of their elements.},
