Hi there! My name is Luiz, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Biomechanics Research Unit](http://www.biomech.ulg.ac.be/) at the [GIGA Institute - In Silico Medicine](https://www.giga.uliege.be/cms/c_4113263/fr/giga), part of the [University of Liège](https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_8699436/en/uliege), in Belgium, since 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Liesbet Geris](http://www.biomech.ulg.ac.be/team/liesbet-geris/). I'm currently working on the [ONTOX project](https://ontox-project.eu/), designing molecular interaction pathway maps, which we call Physiological Maps. But I also collaborate in various other systems biology and toxicology projects and you can find some of them in the [Projects](https://luiz-ladeira.github.io/projects/) tab here.

Before I joined the Biomechanics Research Unit, I graduated with PhD and MSc in [Cell and Structural Biology](http://www.biocel.ufv.br/) from the [Federal University of Viçosa](https://www.ufv.br/), in Brazil. During that period, I researched toxicological and pharmaceutical effects of phytochemicals from native and exotic plant species in different in vivo models for metabolic diseases, such as liver steatosis and type 1 diabetes nephropathy and cardiomyopathy, under the supervision of [Prof. Izabel Maldonado](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2912503249825088). I also collaborated on different environmental and reproductive toxicology projects and food and nutrition projects in different in vivo models.

I am a positive, flexible and resilient person, passionate about learning new things and applying them to solve problems. I also like to share what I learn, and because of that, I engaged as a Volunteer Professor at [Ludic Course of Cell Biology and Histology](https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/297626/1/MARRIEL%20et%20al.%20-%202021%20-%20O%20l%C3%BAdico%20no%20ensino%20de%20biologia%20celular%20possibilidades%20no%20ensino%20superior%20-%20Revista%20ELO%20%E2%80%93%20Di%C3%A1logos%20em%20Extens%C3%A3o.pdf), utilizing active methods in education and attending more than 300 students from various undergrad courses during the 2 years I was there. As a postgrad student, I was a representative for my colleagues, in the Coordination Committee of my program from 2017 to 2019. With my colleagues I created the [Summer School in Cell and Structural Biology](https://www2.dti.ufv.br/noticias/scripts/exibeNoticiaMulti.php?codNot=38980) in 2017 and helped in the organization of the other 2 following editions.

In the University of Liège, I have the opportunity to actively volunteer at the [VPH Institute](https://www.vph-institute.org/) and the [Avicenna Alliance](https://www.avicenna-alliance.com/), in which I contribute to advocating for in silico methods in healthcare and health research.

Some research interests include (but not limited to): Physiology, Physiological Maps, Disease Maps, SBGN, Metabolism, Cell Signaling, Gene Regulation, Ontologies, Adverse Outcome Pathways, Dynamic Modeling, Digital Twins, Networks, Developmental Biology, Hepatology, Immunology, Open Science, FAIR.
