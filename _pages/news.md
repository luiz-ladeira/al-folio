Luiz C. M. Ladeira is a postdoctoral researcher at the Biomechanics Research Unit of the GIGA Institute (In Silico Medicine) at the University of Liège in Belgium and is part of the team in the development of the ONTOX project. He is focused on the development of new methodologies (New Approach Methodologies - NAMs) through the review and systematization of knowledge in human physiology into Physiological Maps to support the creation and improvement of Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs), rationalization of computational models for mechanistic prediction of toxicology, and the construction of ontologies. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Nutrition (2014), a Master's degree (2017), and a Doctorate (2021) in Cell and Structural Biology from the Federal University of Viçosa in Brazil. Currently, his focus is on mapping signaling, metabolic, and regulatory pathways that influence liver function and the development of cognitive functions in the brain.
